### what

> In essence, logic provides a framework for evaluating the validity of arguments and determining whether conclusions logically follow from premises.

##### branches:
* propositional logic
* predicate logic
* modal logic
* mathematical logic

#### core:
logic involves analyzing statements or propositions and their relationships to ascertain whether they lead to a sound and coherent conclusion
#### why

> It helps in distinguishing between ==valid== and ==invalid== forms of reasoning, facilitating clear and ==rational thinking== across different domains, such as *mathematics, philosophy, computer science, and linguistics.*

>Â logic helps us figure out how to put our ideas together in a way that makes sense.

#### analogy

> Imagine an idea to be a certain "block" and logic the "rules" for playing with "blocks" in a good way.
