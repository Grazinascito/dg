 ### ❌ PROBLEMS:
 
* overwhelming systems
* intricate systems

### what solves this problem?

functional decomposition helps us to understand and design the software systems more easily, also create more manageable modules.

### why?

> In simple terms, function decomposition is just a process of tearing apart a system into interrelated parts.

 >The main objective of this is to identify various functions and then understand how they interact with other functions so that we can successfully decompose the functions that are large and complex.

### how?

##### breaking down the steps:

1. identifying the main functions
2. dividing the main functions
3. define the relationships
4. represent the relationships
5. refine the functional decomposition 

> Identifying the main functions means that we try to figure out exactly what a system is supposed to do and also figure out how it works.
