## 12 Steps to Plan a Website Structure

### 1. The client needs a website

Understand the purpose, audience, and key goals of the website.

### 2. Itâ€™s time to fill out the brief

Create a detailed brief outlining project objectives, target audience, and technical requirements.

Develop a visual representation of ideas, including colors, styles, and imagery, to align on the design concept.

### 4. Define user personas

Identify the key user types and their needs to guide the structure.

### 5. Plan user flows

Map out the journey users will take through the site to achieve their goals.

### 6. Create an information architecture

Organize content into categories and subcategories for intuitive navigation.

### 7. Develop a visual sitemap

Build a visual representation of the site's pages and hierarchy to clarify structure.

### 8. Focus on content

Detail the content for each page, ensuring it meets user and business needs.

Design page layouts to show the arrangement of elements without focusing on design details.

### 10. Prototype the website
