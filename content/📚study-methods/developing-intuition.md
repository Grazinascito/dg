## How to learn hard concepts?

An interesting thing about [Developing Your Intuition For Math](https://betterexplained.com/articles/developing-your-intuition-for-math/) article is how it starts by defining a cat ‚Äî yes, the animal üê±. Author challenges us to describe a cat, buuuuut that is too boring. Dont get me wrong, I really do love cats, but I‚Äôm not interested about what‚Äôs _inside_ a cat, KEKW.

> [!warning]
> to fully understand it, you need to be familiar with #decomposition pattern*(break down the problem into smaller pieces)*

so, the first step after identify the theme:

#### 1. make questions

- what do i already know about a "black box"?
- what problems black box solves?
- why we need a black box?
- what was the author thinking when he created a black box?
- what problems he wanted to solve?

if you can think about 2 or 1 answers, great!

we are ready to use the ==out of the box==(XDXD ü•Å) approach that article mentioned!

intuition
each definition is a piece - your intuition is an important piece here.

the whole point is to start from a pieces that you are able to use your intuition.
