wow, its been a while... rs

im facing a crisis right now, its a identity and personality crises cause im struggle to decide my 2025 web persona rs. 

Im almost finish the [[Pragmatic-thinking-and-learning]]( #PTL ) book and broooooo this book is just amazing!! 

lets back to the content, well, i had stop to update this garden due to lot of factors: my poor english output(write and speak) becomes a huge  problem. Me, in the epitome of my mediocrity though i was doing great just consuming(input) english content, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">I couldn’t have been more wrong</mark>!!!
All this years to realises that our brain was poorly diagrammed, yeah, i mean, the brain part that processes content is different from the verbal area #PTL it was amazing discover by reading the #PTL book but damn!!!
There is a lot of common sense in there, but it is the first time that the arguments made my skepticism <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tamed</mark>

BTW, i will write more about it in another occasion 

lets back to the journal:

lots of google meet agendas on my work today, but I noticed im a little more tolerant to meet calls, looks like my auDHD meds are working!!( #atentah #vynvanse) I also feel less anxious. I also find a tool for keep my work notes safe, it could be obsidian but i think obsidian sucks, im using it right now(lol) cause there is no better options, I know know why not #Notion since it is my favourite app in the world? because it is suck to note taking too, ironically. I think Notion is amazing tool for second brain, keep urls, books, habit tracker, goal tracker, study groups... but it sucks on note taking too, that is why Im building my own [[note-taking-app]].

how it is going:
anytype: work stuff,
notion: second brain,
obsidian(temporary): personal wiki

While I was trying to find my tools I just find out amazing retro websites. I really need to do something cool like this:
